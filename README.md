## Project details template

This application (covid 19 tracker) was built using React Js with (Numeral.js,react-chartjs-2,leaflet,react hooks).This project is a single page application where the user can quickly reach the number of cases, recovery, deaths of covid 19 in the world. The project has graphics that are updated daily and is extremely faithful and reliable in its numbers.

This is how the project looks like.

When the user clicks on any of the areas surrounded by the red circles with the titles: Corona virus cases, Recovered and Deaths the map will change and it will filter by only what the user wants.

The area surrounded by the red circle is the place where the user can filter any country in the world with the intention that the map goes to the exact location and show more about covid 19 in the exact country.

This area surrounded by the red rectangle shows the top countries with cases of covid 19 in the moment that the user is researching.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
